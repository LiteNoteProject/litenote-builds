# LiteNote Builds

Make builds for Linux, Windows, and macOS!

(Soon: FreeBSD, OpenBSD)

## Requirements:

* GNU make
* automake, autoconf
* mingw cross compiler (Windows builds)
* debootstrap (Linux builds)
* osxcross (macOS builds)

### Note

The macOS Makefiles must be run as root. If you don't trust them, you can run it in a container or virtual machine.
